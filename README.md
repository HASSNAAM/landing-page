# Apple Landing Page 🍏

## Welcome to the Apple Wonderland! 🍎

Ever dreamt of owning an iPhone 13 Pro Max but got stuck staring at your old flip phone? Well, this landing page is here to tease you with some mouth-watering visuals and make you wonder why you’re not already part of the Apple cult.

## What’s Inside? 📦

- **Slick Header:** Our logo isn’t just a logo. It’s a lifestyle. Navigate through our minimalist yet dazzling menu and pretend you're already one of us.
  
- **Main Attraction:** Drool over the iPhone 13 Pro Max while reading some lorem ipsum that makes it sound even more magical. Click the “All Products” button if you dare to dream bigger.

- **Interactive Icons:** Play with the color-changing icons at the bottom. Yes, it’s as close as you’ll get to owning all the colors of the iPhone 13 Pro Max.

## How to Enjoy This Page 🍏

1. **Gaze at the Logo:** Because why not?
2. **Navigate the Menu:** It’s a digital amusement park for your eyes.
3. **Drool Over the iPhone:** No, seriously, don’t lick your screen.
4. **Change Colors:** Feel the power of changing the iPhone color with a click. It's like magic but better because it's on your screen.
